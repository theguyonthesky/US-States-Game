# US States Game 🇺🇸
This is a Python-based interactive game that helps you learn U.S. state names by placing them correctly on a blank map. It uses the turtle graphics module along with data from a CSV file. 

# How it works
- A map of the U.S. is displayed.

- You’ll be prompted to guess the names of the 50 states.

- When you guess correctly, the state name appears on the map in the right location.

- If you type "Exit", the game ends and generates a CSV file with the states you missed, so you can study them later.

# Tech used
- Python 🐍

- turtle graphics

- pandas for data handling

# Files included
