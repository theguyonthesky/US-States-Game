# US States Game 🇺🇸
This is a Python-based interactive game that helps you learn U.S. state names by placing them correctly on a blank map. It uses the turtle graphics module along with data from a CSV file. 

# How it works
- A map of the U.S. is displayed.

- You’ll be prompted to guess the names of the 50 states.

- When you guess correctly, the state name appears on the map in the right location.

- If you type "Exit", the game ends and generates a CSV file with the states you missed, so you can study them later.

# Tools and modules used
- Python

- `turtle` – to display the map and state names

- `pandas` – to read and write CSV data

# Files included
- `main.py`: The main game logic.

- `blank_states_img.gif`: The map used for the game.

- `50_states.csv`: Contains state names and coordinates.

- `states_to_learn.csv`: Auto-generated list of missed states.
